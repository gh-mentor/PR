@workspace Review and recommend improvements to the PayrollLibrary project. Security and adherence to SOLID design principles are of the utmost importance. 

@workspace I need a technical report describing the 'PR_WebApp' project. Include a comprehensive description of all classes. Highlight key features of the project.

@workspace What libraries for .NET provide a modern, fast, and reliable E2E tests, and SpecFlow for BDD scenarios?

@workspace How do I scaffold MSTest test files for the classes in the 'PayrollLibrary' project?

@workspace Recommend a table design to match the employee class hierarchy in the 'PayrollLibrary' project folder. Use T-SQL to create the tables.

@workspace Show me PostgreSQL commands to create an 'Employees' table with a one-to-one relationship to an 'HourlyEmployees' table and a one-to-one relationship to a 'SalariedEmployees' table. The tables should model the classes: 'Employee', 'SalariedEmployee', 'HourlyEmployee' in the 'PayrollLibrary' project.

@workspace Describe how to use 'latex' to document the classes in the 'PR_WebApp'.
